### Qryn Raggix

Qryn Raggix  is a feature that provides suggestions for potential requests that have results. This feature allows users to preview and select from a list of potential queries and provides logs and additional options for customizing and scheduling queries.

## Overview

Qryn Raggix displays potential requests as squares on the screen. Users can hover over each square to see a preview of the query request. Clicking on a square opens a sample of logs with that request. The request query is displayed above the squares, and a button that says "send query" appears after the request query.

## Features

### Show/hide logs preview

Users have the option to toggle the display of logs preview on or off.

### Select range for previews request

Users can select the range of requests to display for previews.

### Recurrent requests

Users can switch on a "recurrent requests" feature that allows for automatic scheduling of queries. When this feature is activated, a time selector appears with the option to select the frequency of the recurring query. Users can then set a time range for the recurrence.

## How to Use
_Send a query from preview_

1. Switch On Raggix.

6. If it sounds good, click on 'Send Query', to send to current datasource query.
